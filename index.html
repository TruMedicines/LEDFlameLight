A US design patent covers the ornamental design for an object having practical utility. An object with a design that is substantially similar to the design claimed in a design patent cannot be made, used, copied or imported into the United States without the permission of the patent holder. The copy does not have to be exact for the patent to be infringed. It only has to be substantially similar. The goal of copyright law, as set forth in the Copyright Clause of the US Constitution, is "to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."[6] This includes incentivizing the creation of art, literature, architecture, music, and other works of authorship. Design Patent - key design elements Litton Systems, Inc. v. Whirlpool Corp.728 F.2d 1423 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The Federal Circuit stated: “For a design patent to be infringed . . . no matter how similar two items look, ‘the accused device must appropriate the novelty in the patented device which distinguishes it from the prior art.’ That is, even though the court compares two items through the eyes of the ordinary observer, it must nevertheless, to find infringement, attribute their similarity to the novelty which distinguishes the patented device from the prior art.” In this instance there are 3 separate ornamental light bulb design elements which distinguish this light bulb design from all prior art. 1) The top has a convex curved shape 2) The sides are straight 3) The base is a concave curved shape
