        LED FLAME LIGHT ®  The LED Flame light bulb was patented in Dec 21, 2010 US Pat# D629,536 the design was granted a copyright registration May 15, 2010, VAu 1-055-528 the Trademark LED FLame Light was registered on Oct 28, 2025 Serial # 8,001,633. Under US trademark law, governed primarily by the Lanham Act, trademark infringement occurs when an unauthorized use of a mark is likely to cause consumer confusion, deception, or mistake about the source, affiliation, or sponsorship of goods or services. The key test is the "likelihood of confusion," evaluated using factors such as the similarity of the marks, the relatedness of the goods, the strength of the senior mark, evidence of actual confusion, and marketing channels (known as the DuPont factors, derived from case law like *In re E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.*, 476 F.2d 1357 (C.C.P.A. 1973)).

In this scenario, the registered mark appears to be a composite mark (also called a combined or word-plus-design mark), consisting of the textual elements "LED Flame Light" paired with a fire symbol. Composite marks are protected as a whole, but their scope of protection is not limited strictly to the exact depiction; infringement analysis considers the overall commercial impression created by the marks in the marketplace.

### Infringement and Consumer Confusion
Yes, a product using just the words "LED Flame Light" would infringe the registered composite mark and cause customer confusion, particularly if the goods are identical or closely related (e.g., both are lighting products). Here's why:

- **Dominance of Word Elements in Composite Marks**: In analyzing likelihood of confusion for composite marks, courts and the USPTO often give greater weight to the wording over design elements. This is because consumers typically use words to identify, request, or refer to products, while designs may be secondary. For example, the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (TMEP) § 1207.01(c)(ii) states that "greater weight is often given to the wording" in such marks, as supported by cases like *Viterra Inc. v. Canadian Intellectual Property Office*, 671 F.3d 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2012). The Trademarked fire symbol can be infringed if used on product or packaging creating the commercial impression.
